      <p>Here I am going to show you all of my projects I have completed with my first week of learning how to code. I am very proud

    <h2><em>About Me</em></h2>
      <div class="projects">
        <div>I grew up in a military family. Then married the man of my dream and have built a wonderful family. I enjoy doing:
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Crafting</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Gaming</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Swimming</strong></li>

          <li><strong>Going to concerts</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Going on road trips</strong></li>
        </ul>
             I have always struggled trying to find something I want to do when I grow up. I had a career in Phlebotomy for a while.
             I enjoyed my job itself but it is very taxing on my mind and body. I have always been interested in Coding and wanted to
             learn more about it. Once I moved to Seattle I realized that the oppertunities for a jon in the Tech World are massive here.
             So I decided to look up coding bootcamps and found the perfect one for me! Now here I am making my first portfolio, it is amazing!
